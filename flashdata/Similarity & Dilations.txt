w: proportion
def: A statement that two ratios are equal.
w: cross product property
def: Multiplying both sides of a/b=c/d by bd.
w: similar polygons
def: Two figures that have the same shape but not same size.
w: dilation
def: A transformation whose pre-image and image are similar.
w: congruence transformation
def: A transformation in which the image and pre-image have the same side lengths (same size) and angle measurements (same shape).
w: scale factor
def: The ratio of any two corresponding lengths in similar figures; represented by the variable k.
w: ratio
def: The comparison between two amounts showing the number of times on value contains or is contained within the other.
w: perimeter
def: The linear measurement of the boundary of a closed two-dimensional figure (outside distance around figure - add all of the sides together).
w: area
def: Measures the size of surface using length measurements in two-dimensions (inside space of figure - use formula from STAAR chart)
w: dilation algebraic notation
def: ( x , y ) â†’ ( kx , ky )
w: enlargement
def: An image that is larger than the pre-image; a dilation with a scale factor greater than 1 ( k > 1 )
w: reduction
def: An image that is smaller than the pre-image; a dilation with a scale factor less than 1 but greater than 0 ( 0 < k < 1 )
