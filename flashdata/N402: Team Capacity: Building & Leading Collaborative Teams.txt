w: National Interprofessional Competency FrameworkComplexity Quality Improvement Contextual Issues
def: Complexity-Interprofessional collaboration approaches may differ along a continuum from simple to complex-For example, a recreational runner with a sprained ankle may only need to see one or two health care providers and the impact of the injury on the individual's life is minor. However, a sprained ankle for a key member of the national soccer team can have a significant impact on the person's life and will likely require a team of health care providersQuality Improvement-By working together across professions and across institutional roles, improvement activities carried out by interprofessional teams, rather than individuals or uniprofessional teams, more effectively address quality issues, especially in complex systems.Contextual Issues-specific areas of practice such as rehabilitation, residential care, and paediatric care, the competency framework is used in support of a comprehensive and consistent team-Emergency Unit or a high turnover acute medical unit, health care providers may work together only for a short period of time before shifts change and patients are discharged.
